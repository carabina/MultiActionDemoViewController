# MultiActionDemoViewController

There really isn't much to itâ€”just a simple view controller subclass that allows you to
add `Action`s as you see fit.  I get tired of creating the same boilerplate code over and
over when I'm prototyping small things, so this takes that out of the equation.

An `Action` is merely a closure that will be invoked when the button is clicked. Just be
careful to use `[weak self]` if you're referencing anything on the owning object.
